# TopNikes

This gem pulls Nikes top selling mens or womens Nikes based on the Nike.com website.
Users can select to view either Male or Female.

If the scrape does not work, it may likely be due to Nike's end of URL changing.
Please notify myself if that is the case and I will update it.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'top_nikes'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install top_mens_nikes
